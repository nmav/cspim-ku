Some of these test programs are solved assignments (in C) from Appendix of the
third edition of Hennessy & Patterson, Computer Organization and Design: The
Hardware/Software Interface; available at:

http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~larus/HP_AppA.pdf

These programs should be executed with the hostapps/run program.

===

The MASTER sources for the MIPS torture test are *.sm4 files.  To generate a
compileable assembly source from them, use:

m4 cputorture.sm4 > cputorture.s

The pregenerated source is already provided in the distribution.

The test is executed with the hostapps/torture program.  If the test is
successfully passed, the output will be something like (note the '(near
SUCCESS)' in the last line):

(near SUCCESS)

If the execution stops at a label name other than 'SUCCESS' in the last line,
something has gone wrong.
